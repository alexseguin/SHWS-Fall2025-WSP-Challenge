## Student Health and Wellness Coding Challenge

Welcome to the Student Health and Wellness coding challenge. Submission instructions are listed below. The deadline to submit this challenge is **Thursday August 7th, 9:00 AM**. We are looking for effort and creativity, and the challenge is just part of our discussion with you during the interview, so donâ€™t worry if your solution is *hacky* or even if it doesnâ€™t work, we want to see it!


## The Challenge

The challenge is to build a Trivia application, where users are given multiple choice and true/false questions of increasing difficulty.

The design and layout of the trivia web application is up to you (feel free to use any UI libraries), but you will be judged on the look, feel, and usability of your application. Please respect best practices in web design and development.

For this challenge, you will use the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/) to fetch questions.

## API Documentation
For reference, here is the [link](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) to the full API docs. Reading and understand documentation & existing code will be a key part of this role, thus you should be able to figure out how to use this API.


## Achievements
This challenge has several achievements. Try to complete as many as you can in a single project.

### Main Achievements (expected)
- Display boolean (true/false) type questions to the user, with a success message for correct answers.
- Support multiple questions: answering correctly moves to the next question.
- Support multiple choice type questions, also with a success message for correct answers.
- Support different difficulties for the questions (easy, medium, hard).
- Set a win condition for the game (e.g., after a certain number of correct answers, show a congratulations message).

### Stretch Achievements (optional)
- Keep score: harder questions give better rewards.
- Support question categories.
- Add animations to the game experience.
- Show metrics on difficulty and category success rates.
